-----Completed Work-----

Connected NeoPixel Strip and HC-SR01 ultrasonic distance sensors to the WSP32 Firebeetle using SPI and Arduino Libraries.
The LED Strip reflects the distance detected by each distance sensor. 

-----Project Architecture-----

Src - main.ino
contains the setup and main loop

Library
contains NeoPixel Libraries

-----Hardware-----

HC-SR01
const int trigPin = 13;
const int echoPin = 5;
const int trigPin_2 = 25;
const int echoPin_2 = 26;

Neopixel Dstrip
data pin 2

-----Known bugs-----
When connected to battery, the LED strip randomly lights blue and purple when a close distance is detected. (More lights turn on) Likely due to a lack of power to the LED strip.
